- 👋 Hi, Hi, I'm Jose Antonio Torres. I work as a full professor at the University of Almeria. I have a PhD in Computer Engineering and an MBA.
- 👀 My points of interest, in software development programming have to do with Artificial Intelligence, and especially with developing and building new neural network architectures and deep learning, although I spend some of my time on other industrial computing projects. 
I like C language, Matlab and I try to learn Python and Node.js.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and Node.js
- 💞️ I like to learn and help where I can, from my experience, in the design of new software in the world of industrial computing and artificial intelligence.
